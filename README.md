# STM32DiscoveryLLBlink

## Purpose
I created this repository for two reasons:
1. To have a default blinky project for STM32Discrovery Board, with a correct .vscode configuration. VSCode doesn't like STM32 Projects and needs config files to understand header files and correct define, which is annoying to set up every time.
2. Potentially, as an educational resource for other people starting STM32. This project is done using Low Level drivers, with further explanation as to what low level code does, as far as initialisation and use goes.

*Note: I began this project (vscode config) using information found on [this amazing resource](http://shadetail.com/blog/using-visual-studio-code-for-arm-development-introduction/). Please check it out!*

### ToDo:
- [ ] Finish blinky
- [ ] Provide commentary on low level initialization functions
- [ ] Provide commentary on low level writing/reading functions
- [x] Have fun
